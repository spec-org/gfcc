# NOTICE

The Green’s Function Coupled Cluster Library code has moved and has been superseded by **ExaChem**. We strongly encourage users to transition to the [ExaChem open-source computational chemistry package](https://github.com/ExaChem/exachem) for the latest updates and continued development. **ExaChem** incorporates all the functionality of [Green’s Function Coupled Cluster library](https://exachem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/gfcc/gfcc.html) and introduces various enhancements. 


### Thank You!
